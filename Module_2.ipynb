    "Describe A* search in your own words.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading the article, I understand that A* is a search algorithm popular for finding the shortest path between two points efficiently. It's used in applications like navigation systems, games, and robotics. A* works by using a combination of path cost and a heuristic to estimate the shortest route to a target. It evaluates nodes by calculating their total cost function, f(n) = g(n) + h(n), and selects paths that minimize this function, balancing immediate cost and estimated distance to the goal."

    "g(n): This is the actual cost from the start node to the current node n. It represents the path traveled so far.\n",
