# Image Classification with Transfer Learning

## Project Scope
This project involves building a computer vision classifier to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using transfer learning. The dataset comprises labeled images of both classes, resized and augmented for better generalization. We utilized a pre-trained ResNet-18 model in PyTorch, fine-tuning its final layers to adapt it to our binary classification problem. The aim was to achieve high accuracy with minimal training while exploring methods to mitigate overfitting.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alvations/basic-nlp-with-nltk)
- **Key Features**:
  - Images were normalized and augmented with random horizontal flips.
  - Binary labels for two classes: `cats` and `dogs`.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Resized images to a uniform size for efficient processing.
  - Augmented images to improve model generalization.

## Analysis
This project answers several key questions:

### 1. **What training methods were helpful in preventing overfitting?**
- **Data Augmentation**:
  - Applied random horizontal flips to generate diverse views of images.
  - Improved model generalization by exposing it to variations of the same data.
- **Layer Freezing**:
  - Initially froze pre-trained ResNet-18 layers, allowing only the final fully connected layer to learn.
  - Preserved learned features from the original ResNet-18 training.

### 2. **At what point should training be stopped?**
- Training for 5 epochs provided optimal results:
  - Validation accuracy plateaued after 5 epochs.
  - Prolonging training to 10 epochs led to minimal improvement, with signs of overfitting (validation loss stagnated while training loss decreased).

### 3. **What caused misclassifications, and how can they be improved?**
- Misclassifications occurred in images where features overlapped (e.g., close-up fur textures).
- **Recommended Improvements**:
  - Introduce additional augmentations (e.g., rotation, zooming) to enhance feature diversity.
  - Train with higher-resolution images to help the model learn finer details.

## Experiment Results
- **Training Duration**: 5â€“10 epochs.
- **Model**: Pre-trained ResNet-18 with a modified final layer.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: Achieved high accuracy across both classes.
  - Misclassifications primarily occurred in edge cases (e.g., indistinct textures).

## Conclusion
The experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in computer vision tasks. Using ResNet-18, the model achieved excellent classification performance while minimizing computational resources. Techniques like data augmentation and layer freezing played a significant role in improving generalization and preventing overfitting. This approach is well-suited for real-world scenarios with limited datasets.

## Future Considerations
1. **Data Improvements**:
   - Use higher-resolution images to capture finer details for challenging cases.
   - Expand the dataset to include diverse perspectives and challenging examples.
2. **Model Enhancements**:
   - Experiment with more complex architectures like ResNet-50 or VGG-16.
   - Explore hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
3. **Practical Applications**:
   - Develop a web-based interface where users can upload images for real-time classification.
